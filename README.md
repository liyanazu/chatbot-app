# chatbot-app
A simple Streamlit-based chatbot UI that connects to an n8n backend.  This project provides a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit, designed to interact with an n8n workflow (e.g., a RAG pipeline) via HTTP. It allows users to ask questions and receive responses powered by your automated n8n processes.
